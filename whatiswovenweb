Great let me start by articulating Woven Web a bit, and our message.

Right now in our world we are facing a complex and interconnected set of crises; all of which seem to be rooted in a pervasive sense of disconnection from this web of life. Even as we work to address many of these crises, we frequently do it in a rather compartmentalized and fragmented way. Right now it's perhaps more vital than ever for us to learn how to really come together; to cultivate communities with a deep sense of belonging and to foster communication and collaboration across diverse social spheres and organizations. 

While the issues we face are global and universal problems; we have to look local as we work to address them. It's vital that we find ways to cultivate a more connected culture at our local level and then to support solutions emerging at localities all over the world, through engaging in open dialogue and sharing, and through helping to develop and share technological solutions that others can utilize in their own communities.

This is not a task for one organization alone. Woven Web doesn't aim to be the source for all of these solutions or even to own many of them. Rather we aim to be a meaningful participant in this dialogue and to regularly help foster the kind of conversations and collaborations that can move us in this direction. We are in deep partnership with many organizations who are affecting this kind of change in Boulder, as well as organizations who are helping to support these systems rippling out beyond Boulder.

Our biggest offering so far has been a 10-day game we called [CO]here, which has been supporting greater coherence and collaboration within Boulder. As we go forward, we are continuing to cultivate this container of [CO]here as an ongoing space for collaboration and we are working on supporting better technological systems to support our own organizing as well as to support others adopting this blueprint in their own locality.
