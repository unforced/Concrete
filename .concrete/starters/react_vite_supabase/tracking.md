- Begin implementation of the starter template

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Setup

- Use degit to clone a TypeScript Vite React app
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript
- Set up TailwindCSS
- Install and configure shadcn/ui
- Set up Vitest and Playwright for testing

### 2. Authentication

- Install Supabase client
- Create Supabase client configuration
- Implement email/password authentication
- Create sign up, sign in, and sign out functionality
- Implement protected routes

### 3. User Profile System

- Create tests for database operations

### 6. Deployment

- Create configuration for Vercel deployment
- Create configuration for Netlify deployment
- Document deployment process

### 7. Documentation

- Create comprehensive README
- Document project structure
- Create user guide for getting started
- Document testing and deployment procedures

## Open Questions

- Should we include internationalization (i18n) support from the start?
- Should we include a more advanced state management solution like Zustand as an option?
- What specific shadcn/ui components should we include in the starter template?
- Should we include a service worker for offline support?

## Next Steps

1. Finalize the project specification
2. Create the implementation guide for project setup
3. Begin implementation of the starter template
