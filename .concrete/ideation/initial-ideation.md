So, I have already created a pretty solid system that seems to be working in building the Bump app. I still need to continue iterating but it seems like it's been able to do it effectively. Supabase was a challenging part but it got through it and now seems able to do it a lot more effectively, even with complex challenges like OTP. One of my next tasks is to continue iterating on Bump until it comes to completion, to ensure it works and to also see how it does in creating the implementation guides. From here it seems to make sense to ask Cursor to begin to create a templatized version of this. It seems like there are some bits that we should keep as core templates, but we're specifically templating out the various guide files. 

How would something like this be generated?
Most likely there is an initial .cursorrules file that knows how to turn an ideation document such as this into a more fleshed out overview document which contains app specifications but also open questions. This document would then be able to be answered by the user, either by editing the document or by talking to an AI as a way to interface with it. Ideally the document contains instructions for the user on how to relate to the document. Once this document is finalized through user interaction, then this document should serve as the source document to generate the larger file structure containing the full PRD, and the various implementation guides, concepts, templates, etc...
Then a new folder should be created with this .cursorguides (or whatever we call it, perhaps it's .concrete...)
I guess how this would start is by degit'ing your starting template. You either use the base template, or whatever template is most customized for your use case; such as one that is built for React + Supabase, or otherwise. And the concrete system itself should be able to effectively create different templates as needed.

So how I do this is copy-paste the template, ideally the completed form after I run through the app; or perhaps I just instruct the system to start building out the later implementation guides and the system knows that everything is a work in progress; and then I put that into an apps/ folder, and then I ask it to use that to create a new one in templates/ that is a generalized form of this one that applies to any React/Supabase app. And perhaps a further template which applies to any Full Stack (Web/Mobile App with backend) that is a further generalized version of this. Then I think it would make sense for the system to log some kind of hierarchy. Essentially saying that the Bump app inherits from React/Supabase app, and the React/Supabase app inherits from Full Stack. This is not necessarily implying that the Full Stack app is needed to be imported when using one of the children apps, but is rather there for the purpose of updating the system. As any one of the systems involves, it can feed insights backwards and forwards to parents and to children. This essentially enables this whole system to be a constantly evolving system that continually gets better and better at what it is building, constantly learning how to build well and doing so through good feedback from users.

In the future, I suspect it will be beneficial for the super system and the individual systems to be able to be indexed via a RAG database to enable more effective lookup. But let's not integrate that into the first version, we will note that as a potential future feature requiring further research.

So what's the current pathway for me...

Bring the Bump .concrete folder into a freshly cleared out Concrete repository, at apps/Bump.
Create a .concrete folder and within it, create an ideation folder, and place this document as initial-ideation.md
I will then tell Cursor to analyze the apps/Bump folder, and to do so in the context of the idea I am expressing in initial-ideation.md.
The system should then create a project-brief.md within .concrete/ideation which should include an overview of the project we are building as it is currently understood including any open questions to answer. This should all be committed at this point to git. The user should be instructed to read over the project brief and then to engage in dialogue with it, answering questions and clarifying any points that need clarified. The system should use this dialogue to update the project brief until it feels clear. Once everything is clear and clean, the system should begin to generate out the rest of the .concrete folder, including the templates folder, concepts folder, implementation folder, the project.md and index.md files, and any other files and folders that feel relevant, which may have grown beyond our initial structure. Included in this, it should have a .system-prompt file inside of .concrete which should then be symlinked into the root folder as .cursorrules as the first step of building the application.
All of this should be done before we begin to actually build out the rest of what is happening in Concrete. This can be confusing because we're getting pretty meta in the development of this so feel free to clarify if anything doesn't make sense. But essentially, we're working to build out the Concrete application, which is in a sense an artificially intelligent templating system that is intended to be used within AI editors such as Cursor. In the process of building Concrete, we're creating the initial .concrete folder, which is where much of the templating and guide to enable the creation of any app exists, and in this case we are specifying the .concrete for Concrete.

I hope this all makes sense. Right now, the task is simply to do your best to understand, ask any clarifying questions that are needed in this chat and once you feel you have sufficient understanding, to draw up a project brief. There should be sufficient conversational understanding before you draw up the project brief, and then we will engage in further feedback after the project brief is generated.
