The next growth for the app is to integrate better templating. We want the primary .concrete app to include some specs for generating various templates. We then want it to generate those templates as starting points. As an example, we would want it to generate an entire starter application for a React/Vite + Supabase application. The first step of this is to build out the prompting for this at .concrete/starters/react_vite_supabase. And then once this is built out, we should generate the actual application at starters/react_vite_supabase. This should be a fully working application that can serve as an effective starting point for any react supabase app. 

Now when an app is getting started, included in the setup instructions should be to download this starter app. Similar to how we might use degit to start a typical vite/react app, we will use degit to get one of the starter apps such as `degit unforced/concrete/starters/react_vite_supabase`

It is also important that the system begins to better incorporate feedback. So while we have a tracking.md file, we should also have a feedback.md which tracks feedback to the system; so that we can bring a more cohesive sense of feedback after some period of development as we ask the system to improve itself.

I think this system should also incorporate user-required actions better. So there should be somewhere that we inform the user what they have to do. Such as setting up their supabase and plugging in environment variables. This should be able to adapt well to different projects, as there might be a project that involves hardware components and the system will need to instruct a user to set various things up, maybe even wiring circuits. But to start this will often be setting up background services such as supabase and configuring environment variables.

We should also consider how to incorporate new instructions such as this within a project. For this initial concrete project for example, we might be generating a new implementations file which has the instructions about building the react_vite_supabase starter, and it should work on that and keep notes in the tracking document until the implementation is complete.

As always, we should be having a dialogue about this, building a clear action plan, and then unpacking it into various templating/prompting files before we begin any kind of coding. I would like for this whole process going forward to involve a lot more conversation with the user and incorporate a lot more feedback and assurance of mutual understanding. Please discuss how we could incorporate this into the base level concrete system before we take action.

I think we should be a lot more multi-layered in how we're building things. One document should lead to a conversation which leads to mutual understanding which then leads to multiple other documents. Each of these documents becomes another point of conversation before we sign off. I would like to start to defaulting to moving slower and having more feedback before signing off on documents. So initial ideation will probably move to a clear understanding where then the system will say "ok, we're going to build index.md and project.md and create this file structure with these initial files and here's approximately what they will look like". And then I should be able to see those and ensure those are in a good place and make any revisions as needed. And then from there it will start thinking about which further things to implement, such as implementation guides, concept guides, template guides, and more; and it should be letting me know at least an approximation of how it is charting out each of these and ensuring I am giving good sign off along the way. I think going forward, ideation folder should really be for the users ideating; and then the user will ask the system to engage in conversation until clear understanding is achieved and then articulate a plan of action for building out the .concrete system. This means that some of the tracking document should be for how we evolve the concrete system and some of the tracking document should be for how we are building the app from the concrete system. This is why its really important to have systems that maintain a clear and consistent understanding of the whole app and the whole system before we take too much action.
