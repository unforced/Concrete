Welcome to the Concrete project documentation. This guide will help you navigate the project structure and understand how to use the various resources available.

## Directory Structure

The `.concrete` directory contains all the documentation and resources for the Concrete project:

```
.concrete/
├── index.md                # This file
├── project.md              # Project overview and requirements
├── tracking.md             # Project tracking and status
├── system-prompt.md        # System prompt for AI assistants
├── implementations/        # Implementation guides for milestones
├── concepts/               # Concept guides explaining core concepts
├── templates/              # Templates and examples
└── troubleshooting/        # Troubleshooting guides
```

## Core Documentation

- [Project Overview](./project.md) - Overview of the Concrete project and its requirements
- [Project Tracking](./tracking.md) - Current status and progress of the project
- [System Prompt](./system-prompt.md) - System prompt for AI assistants
