# Concrete Project Tracking

## Project Overview
Concrete is an AI-powered templating and project generation system designed to work within AI editors like Cursor. It transforms ideation documents into fully-realized project structures with implementation guides, concepts, templates, and other resources that help developers build applications efficiently.

## Current State
- Initial project structure created
- Core concept guides written (template format, inheritance mechanism, learning mechanism, customization points)
- Implementation guides written (creating new projects, customizing templates, contributing templates)
- Basic template structure defined (base, full-stack, react-supabase)
- System prompt for Cursor created
- README files for all components created

## Current Project Phase
Phase 1: Core System Setup

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Create the basic directory structure for the Concrete system
- [x] Define the template hierarchy and relationships
- [x] Create the system prompt generation mechanism
- [x] Implement the project brief generation from ideation documents
- [x] Create concept guides for template format, inheritance mechanism, learning mechanism, and customization points
- [x] Create implementation guides for creating new projects, customizing templates, and contributing templates
- [x] Set up template directory structure with base, full-stack, and react-supabase templates
- [x] Create README files for all components

### In Progress
- [ ] Set up template files for base template
- [ ] Extract patterns from Bump app into React/Supabase template
- [ ] Implement template inheritance mechanism
- [ ] Develop tools for template selection and customization

### Next Steps
1. Set up template files for base template
2. Extract patterns from Bump app into React/Supabase template
3. Implement template inheritance mechanism
4. Develop tools for template selection and customization
5. Begin Phase 2 (Template Extraction)

## Timeline
- **March 8, 2024**: Initial project structure, concept guides, and implementation guides
- **Next milestone**: Complete Phase 1 (Core System Setup)
- **Future milestone**: Begin Phase 2 (Template Extraction)

## Open Questions
1. How to implement the template inheritance mechanism in a way that's both flexible and easy to use?
2. What's the best way to handle template versioning?
3. How to implement the learning mechanism in a way that's both effective and lightweight?
4. What's the best way to handle template customization points?

## Notes
- The Bump app provides a good reference for how implementation guides should be structured
- Need to ensure that the template format is flexible enough to handle a wide variety of projects
- The learning mechanism should be designed to be as automated as possible while still allowing for human oversight
