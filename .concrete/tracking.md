## Risks and Issues

| Risk/Issue | Impact | Mitigation/Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Complexity of meta-development | High | Focus on clear documentation and examples |
| Balancing flexibility and structure | Medium | Start with proven patterns from Bump app |
| Ensuring AI assistants can effectively use the system | Medium | Test with Cursor throughout development |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Use markdown for documentation | March 8, 2025 | Provides good readability and is widely supported |
| Implement inheritance through metadata | March 8, 2025 | Allows for flexible template relationships |
| Focus on generating .concrete structures | March 8, 2025 | Aligns with primary goal of the project |
| Design primarily for Cursor | March 8, 2025 | Ensures compatibility with primary target platform |
| Use semantic versioning and git tags | March 8, 2025 | Provides clear version tracking |
| Adopt workflow-based approach | March 8, 2025 | Better reflects the conversational nature of Concrete |

## Open Questions

- How should we structure the implementation guides to best support the development of Concrete itself?
- What are the most important concepts to document first?
- How should we handle the symlink between system-prompt.md and .cursorrules across different operating systems?

## Next Milestone Planning

### Implementation and Concept Guides (Target: March 15, 2025)

- [ ] Create remaining implementation guides
- [ ] Create remaining concept guides
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Test the system with Cursor
