## Risks and Issues

| Risk/Issue | Impact | Mitigation/Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Complexity of meta-development | High | Focus on clear documentation and examples |
| Balancing flexibility and structure | Medium | Start with proven patterns from Bump app but simplify where possible |
| Ensuring AI assistants can effectively use the system | Medium | Test with Cursor throughout development |
| Template maintenance overhead | Medium | Focus on core templates and ensure good documentation |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Simplify the template hierarchy approach | March 10, 2025 | Reduce complexity and focus on standalone templates |
| Add feedback.md to each project | March 10, 2025 | Formalize feedback collection for system improvement |
| Start with React/Supabase template | March 10, 2025 | Build on successful patterns from Bump app |
| Improve ideation workflow | March 10, 2025 | Create clearer path from idea to implementation |
| Use markdown for documentation | March 8, 2025 | Provides good readability and is widely supported |
| Focus on generating .concrete structures | March 8, 2025 | Aligns with primary goal of the project |
| Design primarily for Cursor | March 8, 2025 | Ensures compatibility with primary target platform |
| Adopt workflow-based approach | March 8, 2025 | Better reflects the conversational nature of Concrete |

## Open Questions

- What's the best approach for creating a new project from a template? Should we use a CLI tool or rely on conversation with the AI?
- How should we structure the React/Supabase template to make it easily adaptable to different projects?
- What level of detail should be in the implementation guides vs. generated dynamically during conversation?
- How can we improve the feedback loop between template usage and template improvement?

## Next Milestone Planning
