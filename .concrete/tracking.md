  - [ ] Generation mechanism
  - [ ] Inheritance mechanism
  - [ ] CLI interface

## Risks and Issues

| Risk/Issue | Impact | Mitigation/Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Complexity of template inheritance | High | Develop clear documentation and examples |
| Integration with AI assistants | Medium | Establish clear protocols for AI interaction |
| User adoption | Medium | Focus on user experience and documentation |
| Performance of generation process | Medium | Implement caching and optimization strategies |
| CLI usability | Medium | Conduct user testing and gather feedback |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Use markdown for documentation | June 10, 2024 | Provides good readability and is widely supported |
| Implement inheritance mechanism | June 12, 2024 | Enables template composition and reuse |
| Focus on AI-assisted generation | June 13, 2024 | Leverages AI capabilities for better developer experience |
| Adopt modular project structure | June 15, 2024 | Improves maintainability and scalability |
| Support multiple AI models | June 16, 2024 | Provides flexibility and resilience |
| Store system prompt as markdown | June 17, 2024 | Improves readability and version control |

## Open Questions

- How should we handle conflicts in template inheritance?
- What is the best approach for versioning templates?
- How can we ensure consistent generation across different AI models?
- What metrics should we use to evaluate template quality?
- How should we handle offline usage scenarios?

## Next Milestone Planning

### Core System Implementation (Target: June 30, 2024)

- [ ] Implement template parser
- [ ] Implement customization point resolver
- [ ] Implement generation mechanism
- [ ] Implement inheritance mechanism
- [ ] Create CLI interface
- [ ] Develop testing framework
- [ ] Set up AI integration

## Notes

- Consider adding a visual editor for template customization
- Explore integration with popular IDEs
- Research existing templating systems for best practices
- Investigate containerization for consistent environments
- When continuing development, start with creating the implementation guides for the next milestones
