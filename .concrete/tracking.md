## Risks and Issues

| Risk/Issue | Impact | Mitigation/Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Complexity of meta-development | High | Focus on clear documentation and examples |
| Balancing flexibility and structure | Medium | Start with proven patterns but simplify where possible |
| Ensuring AI assistants can effectively use the system | Medium | Test with Cursor throughout development |
| Template maintenance overhead | Medium | Focus on core templates and ensure good documentation |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Implement React/Vite + Supabase starter template | March 10, 2025 | Provides a working example for users to reference |
| Create starter_apps directory | March 10, 2025 | Separates template implementations from specifications |
| Create comprehensive React/Vite + Supabase specification | March 10, 2025 | Provides detailed guidance for implementation |
| Move starter specifications outside .concrete | March 10, 2025 | Simplifies structure and makes specs more accessible |
| Create React/Vite + Supabase specification | March 10, 2025 | Provides a concrete example of the templating approach |
| Delete redundant index.md | March 10, 2025 | Simplifies navigation and reduces redundancy |
| Update root README.md | March 10, 2025 | Ensures consistency between root and .concrete documentation |
| Use universal system prompt | March 10, 2025 | Ensures consistency across projects while reducing maintenance burden |
| Consolidate documentation into README.md | March 10, 2025 | Simplifies navigation and reduces redundancy |
| Add conversations directory | March 10, 2025 | Preserve insights from discussions that bridge ideation and implementation |
| Clear out existing directories | March 10, 2025 | Many existing files were created without proper understanding of the vision |
| Focus on React/Vite + Supabase starter | March 10, 2025 | Provides a concrete example of the templating approach |

## Open Questions

1. **Starter Template Implementation**
   - What additional components should be added to the starter template?
   - How should we handle versioning and updates to the starter template?

2. **README.md in root vs. .concrete**
   - How should the root README.md relate to the .concrete/README.md?
   - What content should be in each?

3. **Implementation of React/Vite + Supabase starter**
   - What additional features should be included in the starter template?
   - How should we handle versioning and updates to the starter template?

## Next Milestone Planning

- [x] Create specification document
- [x] Create starter_apps directory
- [x] Implement the template based on the specification
- [x] Add authentication and database integration
- [ ] Add additional UI components and features
- [ ] Document setup and customization process
