2. Implement conversation-driven development approach
3. Create React/Vite + Supabase starter template specification
4. Consolidate documentation into README.md

## Recent Updates

- **March 10, 2025**: Created tracking.md

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Create conversations directory with template and README
- ✅ Revise system-prompt.md to universal approach
- ✅ Create consolidated README.md
- ✅ Create starters directory structure
- ✅ Update conversation summary with recent progress
- ✅ Create tracking.md

## Next Tasks

- [ ] Create React/Vite + Supabase specification
- [ ] Delete redundant files (index.md, project.md)
- [ ] Update root README.md to align with .concrete/README.md
- [ ] Review and update/remove existing workflow documents
- [ ] Begin implementation of React/Vite + Supabase starter template

## Risks and Issues

| Risk/Issue | Impact | Mitigation/Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Complexity of meta-development | High | Focus on clear documentation and examples |
| Balancing flexibility and structure | Medium | Start with proven patterns but simplify where possible |
| Ensuring AI assistants can effectively use the system | Medium | Test with Cursor throughout development |
| Template maintenance overhead | Medium | Focus on core templates and ensure good documentation |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Use universal system prompt | March 10, 2025 | Ensures consistency across projects while reducing maintenance burden |
| Consolidate documentation into README.md | March 10, 2025 | Simplifies navigation and reduces redundancy |
| Add conversations directory | March 10, 2025 | Preserve insights from discussions that bridge ideation and implementation |
| Clear out existing directories | March 10, 2025 | Many existing files were created without proper understanding of the vision |
| Focus on React/Vite + Supabase starter | March 10, 2025 | Provides a concrete example of the templating approach |

## Open Questions

1. **Starters directory structure**
   - What exactly should go into the `.concrete/starters/react_vite_supabase` directory?
   - How detailed should the specifications be versus the actual implementation?

2. **README.md in root vs. .concrete**
   - How should the root README.md relate to the .concrete/README.md?
   - What content should be in each?

3. **Handling of existing workflow documents**
   - Should we keep, update, or remove the existing workflow documents?
   - How do they fit into the new conversation-driven approach?

## Next Milestone Planning

- [ ] Create specification document
- [ ] Define file structure and key components
- [ ] Implement basic functionality
- [ ] Add authentication and database integration
- [ ] Document setup and customization process
