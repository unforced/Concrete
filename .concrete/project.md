# Concrete Project Overview

**Date**: March 8, 2025  
**Authors**: Unforced, Claude 3.7 Sonnet

## Project Vision

Concrete is an AI-powered system that helps create consistent, well-structured projects through conversational AI development. The name "Concrete" comes from "Converse & Create" - emphasizing the conversational approach to project creation. Concrete generates `.concrete` directories that serve as intelligent guides for AI assistants like Cursor, providing context and structure for building applications and other digital artifacts.

## Problem Statement

Developers often spend significant time setting up new projects, implementing boilerplate code, and establishing best practices. This process is repetitive and time-consuming, especially when starting new projects or working with unfamiliar technologies. Additionally, while AI assistants can generate code, they often lack the context and structure needed to create cohesive, well-organized projects.

## Solution

Concrete addresses these challenges by providing:

1. **Conversational Project Creation**: Transform ideation conversations into structured project guides
2. **Intelligent Resource Generation**: Generate implementation guides, concept guides, templates, and troubleshooting resources
3. **Interconnected Documentation**: Create cross-linked resources that provide context for AI assistants
4. **Customization and Flexibility**: Support various project types and structures with customizable templates
5. **Learning and Evolution**: Improve templates based on feedback and successful implementations

## Key Features

### 1. Conversational Project Creation

Concrete enables developers to:
- Express project requirements through natural conversation
- Refine project specifications through dialogue
- Generate structured project briefs from ideation conversations
- Transform project briefs into complete project guides

### 2. Intelligent Resource Generation

Concrete generates:
- **Implementation Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for implementing project milestones
- **Concept Guides**: Explanations of core concepts and patterns
- **Templates**: Reusable patterns for creating consistent code and documentation
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Solutions for common issues and best practices

### 3. Interconnected Resources

Concrete creates resources that are:
- Cross-linked for easy navigation
- Contextually relevant to each other
- Organized in a way that AI assistants can easily understand
- Structured to provide maximum context when needed

### 4. Customization and Flexibility

Concrete supports:
- Various project types and structures
- Customizable templates for different use cases
- Flexible directory structures based on project needs
- Adaptation to different development workflows

### 5. Learning and Evolution

Concrete improves through:
- Feedback collection from users
- Analysis of successful project implementations
- Evolution of templates based on best practices
- Continuous refinement of generation mechanisms

## User Personas

### 1. Solo Developer

- **Needs**: Quick project setup, best practices, comprehensive documentation
- **Pain Points**: Limited time, context switching between technologies
- **How Concrete Helps**: Provides ready-to-use templates with best practices and documentation

### 2. Team Lead

- **Needs**: Consistent project structure, enforced best practices, onboarding resources
- **Pain Points**: Ensuring team consistency, maintaining documentation
- **How Concrete Helps**: Establishes standardized project structures and documentation

### 3. AI Assistant User

- **Needs**: Structured guidance for AI, context for code generation
- **Pain Points**: Disjointed code generation, lack of project-wide context
- **How Concrete Helps**: Provides structured instructions for AI assistants to generate cohesive projects

## Technical Architecture

### Directory Structure

The Concrete system uses the following directory structure:

```
concrete/
├── .concrete/               # Documentation and resources for Concrete itself
├── apps/                    # Generated app templates
├── templates/               # Base templates for different project types
└── .cursorrules             # Symlink to .concrete/system-prompt.md
```

The `.concrete` directory contains:

```
.concrete/
├── index.md                # Navigation guide
├── project.md              # Project overview
├── tracking.md             # Project progress
├── system-prompt.md        # AI instructions
├── implementations/        # Implementation guides
├── concepts/               # Concept guides
├── templates/              # Templates
└── troubleshooting/        # Troubleshooting guides
```

### Template Inheritance

Templates in Concrete can inherit from parent templates, allowing for:
- Reuse of common functionality
- Specialization for specific use cases
- Composition of multiple templates

Inheritance is implemented through metadata at the top of markdown files, with an index in the README that shows relationships between templates.

### Learning Mechanism

Concrete includes multiple feedback mechanisms:
- Dedicated feedback files auto-generated from user conversations
- Annotations in existing files
- Analysis of successful project implementations

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core System

- Develop the `.concrete` directory for Concrete itself
- Create core documentation and system prompt
- Implement basic templates and guides

### Phase 2: Template Generation

- Develop mechanisms for generating templates
- Create specialized templates for common use cases
- Implement template inheritance

### Phase 3: Learning System

- Implement feedback collection
- Develop template evolution mechanisms
- Create analysis tools for successful implementations

## Success Criteria

The Concrete project will be successful if it:

1. Creates a complete `.concrete` directory for Concrete itself
2. Establishes a clear, navigable, and well-documented structure
3. Provides an effective system prompt for AI assistants
4. Can be used to help develop itself (meta-development)
5. Supports various project types with flexible templates

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

- Initial focus on Cursor as the primary AI assistant
- Limited to text-based project generation (no binary files)
- Requires user interaction for refinement

### Assumptions

- AI assistants will continue to improve in code generation capabilities
- Users will see value in using templates over starting from scratch
- Feedback loop will improve templates over time

## Glossary
