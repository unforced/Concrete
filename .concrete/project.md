**Authors**: Unforced, Claude 3.7 Sonnet

## Project Vision

Concrete is an AI-powered templating and project generation system designed to work within AI editors like Cursor. It transforms ideation documents into fully-realized project structures with implementation guides, concepts, templates, and other resources that help developers build applications efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Developers often spend significant time setting up new projects, implementing boilerplate code, and establishing best practices. This process is repetitive and time-consuming, especially when starting new projects or working with unfamiliar technologies. Additionally, while AI assistants can generate code, they often lack the context and structure needed to create cohesive, well-organized projects.

## Solution

Concrete addresses these challenges by providing:

1. **Structured Templates**: Pre-defined project structures with best practices built-in
2. **AI-Powered Generation**: Instructions for AI assistants to generate code that follows consistent patterns
3. **Implementation Guides**: Step-by-step guides for implementing features and functionality
4. **Conceptual Documentation**: Explanations of key concepts and architectural decisions
5. **Learning Mechanism**: A system that improves templates based on user feedback and usage patterns

## Key Features

### 1. Template Hierarchy

Concrete uses a hierarchical approach to templates:

- **Base Templates**: Foundational templates with common utilities and patterns
- **Specialized Templates**: Templates for specific tech stacks (e.g., React/Supabase)
- **Project Templates**: Complete application templates for specific use cases

### 2. Template Format

Each template includes:

- **Metadata**: Template properties, dependencies, and customization points
- **Documentation**: Human-readable guides and documentation
- **Template Files**: Actual code files with special syntax for customization points
- **Generation Instructions**: Natural language instructions for AI to generate custom components

### 3. Inheritance Mechanism

Templates can inherit from parent templates, allowing for:

- **Reuse**: Inheriting common functionality from parent templates
- **Specialization**: Overriding or extending parent templates for specific needs
- **Composition**: Combining multiple templates to create new templates

### 4. Learning Mechanism

Concrete includes a learning mechanism that:

- **Collects Feedback**: Gathers feedback from users on template quality and usefulness
- **Analyzes Usage**: Tracks how templates are used and customized
- **Improves Templates**: Updates templates based on feedback and usage patterns

### 5. Customization Points

Templates include customization points that allow users to:

- **Configure**: Set project-specific properties (name, description, etc.)
- **Select Options**: Choose between different implementation options
- **Extend**: Add custom functionality to the template
