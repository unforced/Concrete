# Concrete Project Overview

**Date**: March 8, 2024  
**Authors**: Unforced, Claude 3.7 Sonnet

## 1. Overview

**Purpose**:  
Concrete is an AI-powered templating and project generation system designed to work within AI editors like Cursor. It transforms ideation documents into fully-realized project structures with implementation guides, concepts, templates, and other resources that help developers build applications efficiently.

**Goals**:  
- *Core*: Enable efficient project generation through AI-powered templates
- *MVP Success*: Successfully generate 3 different types of projects from templates
- *Qualitative*: Users report significant time savings and improved project structure
- *Long-Term*: Create a self-improving ecosystem of templates with community contributions

**Target Audience**:  
Developers using AI-powered editors like Cursor who want to quickly bootstrap projects with best practices and comprehensive documentation.

## 2. System Architecture

### Template Hierarchy

```
Base Templates
    ↑
Specialized Templates
    ↑
App Implementations
```

### Template Format

Each template consists of:

1. **Metadata** (`concrete.yaml`): Defines template properties, dependencies, and customization points
2. **Documentation** (`docs/`): Human-readable guides and documentation
3. **Template Files** (`template/`): Actual code files with special syntax for customization points
4. **Generation Instructions** (`generation/`): Natural language instructions for AI to generate custom components

### Workflow

1. **Ideation**: User creates an initial ideation document
2. **Project Brief**: System generates a structured project brief with specifications and questions
3. **Refinement**: User interacts with the system to refine the brief
4. **Template Selection**: System selects appropriate template based on project brief
5. **Customization**: Template is customized based on project requirements
6. **Generation**: System generates complete project structure with guides, concepts, and templates
7. **Implementation**: User follows the guides to implement the application
8. **Feedback**: Insights from implementation feed back into the template system

## 3. Core Components

### 1. Ideation Processing

- **Input**: Initial ideation document (markdown)
- **Process**: AI analyzes the document to understand project requirements
- **Output**: Structured project brief with specifications and questions

### 2. Project Brief Refinement

- **Input**: Project brief and user feedback
- **Process**: Iterative refinement through dialogue
- **Output**: Finalized project brief

### 3. Template Selection and Customization

- **Input**: Finalized project brief
- **Process**: Selection of appropriate template and customization
- **Output**: Customized template for the specific project

### 4. Guide Generation

- **Input**: Customized template and project brief
- **Process**: Generation of implementation guides, concepts, and other resources
- **Output**: Complete project structure

### 5. System Prompt Generation

- **Input**: Project structure
- **Process**: Creation of system prompt for AI assistants
- **Output**: .system-prompt file (symlinked to .cursorrules)

### 6. Learning Mechanism

- **Input**: User feedback and modifications
- **Process**: Analysis of changes and identification of patterns
- **Output**: Improved templates and propagation of changes

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core System Setup

1. Create the basic directory structure for the Concrete system
2. Define the template hierarchy and relationships
3. Create the system prompt generation mechanism
4. Implement the project brief generation from ideation documents

### Phase 2: Template Extraction

1. Analyze the Bump app implementation
2. Extract patterns and structures into a React/Supabase template
3. Further generalize into a full-stack template
4. Create a base template for any application

### Phase 3: Integration and Tooling

1. Create tools for template selection and customization
2. Implement mechanisms for template inheritance
3. Develop utilities for easy template installation (e.g., degit integration)
4. Create documentation for using the system

### Phase 4: Learning and Improvement

1. Implement feedback mechanisms for templates
2. Create systems for propagating improvements up and down the hierarchy
3. Develop metrics for template effectiveness
4. Build a community around template sharing and improvement

## 5. Success Metrics

- **Template Usage**: Number of projects created using templates
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of projects that reach completion
- **Modification Rate**: How much of the template is kept vs. modified
- **Time to MVP**: How quickly users can reach a minimum viable product
- **User Satisfaction**: Surveys or feedback on template quality
- **Learning Curve**: How quickly users understand and can work with the template
- **Community Growth**: Number of contributed templates and improvements

## 6. Future Directions

- **Template Registry**: Central registry for sharing templates
- **Visual Editor**: GUI for template customization
- **Integration with Other Editors**: Support for editors beyond Cursor
- **Advanced Learning**: More sophisticated learning mechanisms
- **Domain-Specific Templates**: Templates for specific domains (e.g., e-commerce, social media)
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Templates for web, mobile, desktop, etc.

## 7. Open Questions

1. **Template Format**: What is the most effective format for templates that balances flexibility with ease of use?
2. **Inheritance Mechanism**: How should template inheritance be implemented to allow for specialization while maintaining consistency?
3. **Versioning**: How should templates be versioned to track changes and improvements?
4. **Customization Points**: What are the key points where users should be able to customize templates?
5. **Integration Method**: What's the best way for users to integrate Concrete into their workflow?
6. **Learning Mechanism**: How should the system capture and incorporate learnings from implementations?
7. **Community Aspects**: How can we foster a community around template sharing and improvement?
8. **Evaluation Metrics**: How do we measure the effectiveness of templates in helping users build applications?
