# Conversation Summary: Growing the Concrete App

**Date**: March 10, 2025  
**Participants**: Unforced, Claude 3.7 Sonnet  
**Context**: Discussion following the updated growing-the-app.md ideation document to clarify the vision for Concrete's evolution

## Key Points Discussed

1. **Better Templating Approach**
   - Need for a starters directory with template specifications
   - Focus on creating a React/Vite + Supabase starter template
   - Templates should be usable via degit (e.g., `degit unforced/concrete/starters/react_vite_supabase`)

2. **Conversation-Driven Development**
   - Emphasis on dialogue before action
   - Multi-layered approach: document → conversation → understanding → more documents
   - Need for more feedback checkpoints throughout the development process

3. **Feedback Integration**
   - Addition of feedback.md to track system feedback
   - Using feedback to periodically improve the system
   - Later decided to capture feedback through conversation summaries instead

4. **User Action Guidance**
   - Clear specification of required user actions (e.g., setting up Supabase, environment variables)
   - Adaptability to different project types

5. **Project Structure Revision**
   - Need to start from a clearer slate
   - Many existing components don't reflect the correct understanding
   - Addition of a conversations directory to capture dialogue insights

6. **Documentation Consolidation**
   - Combining index.md and project.md into a single README.md
   - Creating a universal system prompt that points to project-specific README.md
   - Simplifying the overall structure while maintaining comprehensive documentation

## Decisions Made

1. **Clear out existing directories**
   - **Rationale**: Many existing files were created without proper understanding of the vision
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Keeping and modifying existing files

2. **Add conversations directory**
   - **Rationale**: Preserve insights from discussions that bridge ideation and implementation
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Relying solely on ideation documents and implementation guides

3. **Create conversation summary template**
   - **Rationale**: Ensure consistent capture of key points, decisions, and action items
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Free-form conversation notes

4. **Focus on starters directory next**
   - **Rationale**: This represents the core of the new templating approach
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Focusing first on revising core documentation

5. **Use universal system prompt**
   - **Rationale**: Ensures consistency across projects while reducing maintenance burden
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Project-specific prompts or a hybrid approach

6. **Consolidate documentation into README.md**
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies navigation and reduces redundancy
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Keeping separate index.md and project.md files

## Open Questions

1. **Starters directory structure**
   - What exactly should go into the `.concrete/starters/react_vite_supabase` directory?
   - How detailed should the specifications be versus the actual implementation?

2. **README.md in root vs. .concrete**
   - How should the root README.md relate to the .concrete/README.md?
   - What content should be in each?

3. **Handling of existing workflow documents**
   - Should we keep, update, or remove the existing workflow documents?
   - How do they fit into the new conversation-driven approach?

## Action Items

1. ✅ **Create conversations directory**
   - **Owner**: Claude with Unforced's feedback
   - **Timeline**: Completed March 10, 2025
   - **Details**: Created directory with template and README

2. ✅ **Revise system-prompt.md**
   - **Owner**: Claude with Unforced's feedback
   - **Timeline**: Completed March 10, 2025
   - **Details**: Created universal prompt that emphasizes conversation and points to README.md

3. ✅ **Create consolidated README.md**
   - **Owner**: Claude with Unforced's feedback
   - **Timeline**: Completed March 10, 2025
   - **Details**: Combined index.md and project.md into comprehensive README.md

4. ✅ **Create starters directory structure**
   - **Owner**: Claude with Unforced's feedback
   - **Timeline**: Completed March 10, 2025
   - **Details**: Created .concrete/starters/react_vite_supabase directory

5. **Create React/Vite + Supabase specification**
   - **Owner**: Claude with Unforced's feedback
   - **Timeline**: Next step
   - **Details**: Define what should go into the starter template

6. **Delete redundant files**
   - **Owner**: Unforced or Claude
   - **Timeline**: After confirming they're no longer needed
   - **Details**: Remove index.md and project.md once README.md is finalized

## Next Conversation

**Proposed Topic**: React/Vite + Supabase starter template specification  
**Proposed Date**: After feedback on README.md and system prompt  
**Preparation Needed**: Research on best practices for React/Vite + Supabase projects and review of Bump app structure
