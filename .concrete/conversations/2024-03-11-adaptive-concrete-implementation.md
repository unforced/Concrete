# Conversation Summary: Adaptive Concrete Implementation

**Date:** March 11, 2024

## What Was Accomplished

- Created a new Adaptive Concrete template designed to analyze and adapt to existing projects
- Implemented the following components:
  - System prompt with instructions for repository analysis and adaptation
  - Repository analysis guide with steps for understanding existing projects
  - Guide for capturing new ideas and directions
  - Adaptive README template with placeholders for project information
  - Minimal tracking template focused on current state
  - Placeholder files for conversations and ideation directories
- Updated project documentation:
  - Added Milestone 3 to `.concrete/tracking.md`
  - Updated `.concrete/README.md` to include the new template
  - Created guide file `.concrete/guides/03-create-adaptive-concrete.md`

## Key Discussion Points

- Discussed the need for a concrete template that can adapt to existing projects
- Explored how to analyze an existing repository to understand its structure and purpose
- Developed an approach for documenting the current state of a project as a baseline
- Created a process for capturing new ideas and directions after establishing the baseline
- Emphasized the importance of respecting existing project conventions and workflows

## Design Decisions

- **Minimal Initial Documentation**: The tracking.md starts with just documenting the current state rather than prescribing specific milestones
- **Two-Phase Approach**: First analyze the repository, then capture new ideas and directions
- **Respect Existing Structure**: Focus on complementing rather than replacing existing documentation
- **Adaptive Templates**: Created templates with placeholders that will be filled based on repository analysis
- **Guided Analysis Process**: Provided detailed steps for exploring and understanding an existing codebase

## Project Status

The Concrete project now includes three templates:
- ✅ Base Concrete: Generic foundation for new projects
- ✅ Vite-Supabase Concrete: Specialized template for React/Vite and Supabase projects
- ✅ Adaptive Concrete: Template for analyzing and adapting to existing projects

## Next Steps

1. Test the Adaptive Concrete template on a real project
2. Refine the template based on testing feedback
3. Consider adding more specialized concrete templates in the future
4. Document usage examples and best practices
