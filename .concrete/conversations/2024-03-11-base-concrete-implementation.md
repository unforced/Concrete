# Conversation Summary: Base Concrete Implementation

**Date:** March 11, 2024

## What Was Accomplished

- Created the base concrete template with a focus on conversation flow and adaptation to user vision
- Implemented essential files:
  - system-prompt.md: Guidelines for facilitating conversation and adapting to user vision
  - README.md: Simple explanation of the Concrete structure and how to use it
  - tracking.md: Minimal structure for tracking progress
- Created essential directories with helpful README files:
  - conversations/: For storing summaries of important discussions
  - ideation/: For user thoughts and brainstorming
  - guides/: For milestone-specific instruction files
- Tested and committed the base concrete template
- Improved the system prompt with detailed guidance on:
  - The complete `.concrete` folder structure and purpose of each component
  - Proper file paths (e.g., `.concrete/conversations/` instead of just `conversations/`)
  - The importance of `.concrete/README.md` as the main project document
  - Regular updates to `.concrete/tracking.md`
  - Regular git commits with meaningful messages
  - Adapting documentation based on user conversations

## Key Discussion Points

- Refined the approach for Base Concrete to focus on facilitating conversation and adapting to user vision
- Emphasized the importance of a minimal structure that can be easily extended
- Focused on creating a system that helps users share their ideas and vision
- Designed the system prompt to prioritize active listening and clarification
- Identified and addressed gaps in the system prompt regarding proper file paths and maintenance procedures
- Discussed the importance of being conversational and ensuring clear understanding before executing tasks

## Next Steps

- Begin work on Milestone 2: Create Vite-Supabase Concrete
- Copy the base concrete template to vite-supabase
- Customize for React/Vite and Supabase projects
