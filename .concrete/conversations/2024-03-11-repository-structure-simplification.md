**Date:** March 11, 2024

## What Was Accomplished

- Simplified the repository structure:
  - Removed the `concrete-libs/` directory, placing templates directly in the root folder
  - Removed the `starter-projects/` directory
  - Updated all documentation to reflect these changes

- Updated the following files:
  - `.concrete/README.md`: Updated project structure and usage instructions
  - `.concrete/tracking.md`: Updated project structure and next steps
  - `.concrete/guides/00-project-setup.md`: Updated directory creation instructions
  - `.concrete/guides/01-create-base-concrete.md`: Updated file paths
  - `.concrete/guides/02-create-vite-supabase-concrete.md`: Updated file paths and next steps

## Key Discussion Points

- Discussed the benefits of simplifying the repository structure
- Recognized that the repository should be a straightforward library of concrete templates
- Ensured all documentation accurately reflects the new structure
- Maintained the core functionality while making the repository more intuitive to use

## Project Status

The Concrete project is now complete with a simplified structure:

- ✅ Milestone 0: Project Setup
- ✅ Milestone 1: Create Base Concrete
- ✅ Milestone 2: Create Vite-Supabase Concrete
- ✅ Simplified repository structure

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more specialized concrete templates in the future
2. Document usage examples and best practices
