# Conversation: README and System Prompt Consolidation

**Date:** March 15, 2024

## Summary

In this conversation, we discussed and implemented a simplification of the Concrete file structure by combining the `system-prompt.md` and `README.md` files into a single file. This change was made to:

1. Create a single source of truth for both human readers and AI assistants
2. Simplify maintenance by having only one file to update
3. Improve adaptability by making it easier to migrate between different AI systems
4. Enhance discoverability by using the standard README.md file that users and tools naturally look for

## Key Decisions

1. Combined the content from `system-prompt.md` and `README.md` into a single `README.md` file
2. Organized the combined file with a logical flow:
   - Project introduction and vision
   - AI Assistant Guidelines section (containing the system prompt instructions)
   - Project Structure
   - Milestones
   - Workflow
3. Updated the `.cursorrules` symlink to point to the new combined `README.md` file
4. Updated the `tracking.md` file to reflect these changes
5. Planned to update the other concrete templates (base, vite-supabase, adaptive) to use this same approach

## Implementation Details

The implementation involved:

1. Creating a new combined `README.md` file that incorporates both the project documentation and AI system prompt
2. Updating the `.cursorrules` symlink to point to the new combined file
3. Updating the `tracking.md` file to reflect the changes
4. Planning to apply the same changes to the other concrete templates

## Next Steps

1. Update the other concrete templates (base, vite-supabase, adaptive) to use the combined README.md approach
2. Test the updated templates to ensure they work correctly
3. Consider adding more specialized concrete templates in the future
4. Document usage examples and best practices
