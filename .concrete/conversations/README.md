# Conversations

This directory contains summaries of important conversations related to the Concrete project's development. These summaries serve as a bridge between ideation and implementation, preserving key insights and decisions that emerge during discussions.

## Purpose

The conversations directory addresses several important needs:

1. **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures valuable insights that might otherwise be lost
2. **Decision Documentation**: Records why certain decisions were made
3. **Context Building**: Provides context for implementation choices
4. **Continuity**: Ensures smooth transitions between development sessions
5. **Feedback Integration**: Documents user feedback for system improvement

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create a Conversation Summary

Create a conversation summary when:
- Discussing a new ideation document
- Making significant decisions about project direction
- Resolving important questions or challenges
- Providing substantial feedback on the system

### How to Create a Conversation Summary

1. Copy the template.md file to a new file named with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-topic.md`
2. Fill in all sections of the template
3. Be sure to capture:
   - Key points from the discussion
   - Decisions made and their rationale
   - Open questions that need further consideration
   - Specific action items with owners and timelines

### How to Use Conversation Summaries

Conversation summaries should be referenced when:
- Creating or updating implementation guides
- Revising project documentation
- Addressing open questions
- Following up on action items
- Preparing for subsequent conversations

## Relationship to Other Documents

- **Ideation Documents**: Conversations often start from ideation documents
- **Project Brief**: Decisions from conversations inform the project brief
- **Implementation Guides**: Action items from conversations lead to implementation guides
- **Tracking Document**: Action items should be reflected in the tracking document
- **Feedback Document**: User feedback from conversations should be added to feedback.md
