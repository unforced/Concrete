```

## Working with the User

When working with a user on the Concrete project, follow these guidelines:

### 1. Understanding User Intent

- **Project Creation**: If the user wants to create a new project, help them define the project requirements and generate a project brief.
- **Template Generation**: If the user wants to create a new template, help them define the template structure and generate the necessary files.
- **System Improvement**: If the user wants to improve the Concrete system itself, help them identify areas for improvement and implement changes.

### 2. Generating Resources

When generating resources for Concrete, follow these principles:

- **Consistency**: Ensure that all resources follow the established formats and conventions.
- **Clarity**: Make sure that all resources are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- **Interconnectedness**: Create resources that are cross-linked and contextually relevant to each other.
- **Completeness**: Ensure that all necessary information is included in each resource.

### 3. Improving the System

When suggesting improvements to the Concrete system, consider:

- **User Feedback**: Pay attention to user feedback and incorporate it into your suggestions.
- **System Goals**: Ensure that your suggestions align with the goals of the Concrete system.
- **Best Practices**: Incorporate best practices from software development, documentation, and AI-assisted development.

## Version Control and Commit Practices

When working on the Concrete project, follow these version control guidelines:

### 1. Regular Commits

- **Commit Frequently**: Make small, focused commits that represent logical units of work.
- **Commit After Milestones**: Always commit after completing a significant milestone or feature.
- **Commit Before Major Changes**: Create a commit before starting major refactoring or changes.

### 2. Detailed Commit Messages

- **Use Descriptive Titles**: Begin with a concise summary (50 chars or less) that describes what changed.
- **Include Detailed Body**: Add a more detailed explanation of what was changed and why.
- **Reference Issues**: If applicable, reference related issues or tasks.

### 3. Commit Message Format

Use this format for commit messages:
```
[area]: Short summary of changes (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation of what was changed and why.
- List specific changes if helpful
- Mention any important considerations

Refs: #issue-number (if applicable)
```

### 4. Commit Reminders

- **Remind the User**: Periodically remind the user to commit their changes, especially after completing significant work.
- **Suggest Commit Messages**: Offer suggested commit messages that follow the format above.
- **Track Uncommitted Changes**: Help the user keep track of uncommitted changes that should be included in the next commit.

## Resource Types

- Follow a consistent format
- Include clear objectives, prerequisites, and steps
- Link to relevant concepts, templates, and troubleshooting guides
- Provide validation criteria for completion

### Concept Guides

Concept guides explain core concepts and patterns. They should:

- Explain concepts clearly
- Include examples and best practices
- Reference related concepts and implementation guides
- Provide context for why the concept is important

### Templates

Templates provide reusable patterns for creating consistent code and documentation. They should:

- Be easily adaptable
- Include placeholders for customization
- Provide clear instructions for use

## Conversational Approach

When working with the user, maintain a conversational approach:

1. **Listen**: Pay attention to the user's requirements and feedback.
2. **Ask Questions**: Seek clarification when needed to ensure you understand the user's intent.
3. **Provide Options**: When multiple approaches are possible, present options with pros and cons.
4. **Explain**: Provide explanations for your suggestions and actions.
5. **Learn**: Incorporate user feedback to improve your assistance.

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Creating a New Project Brief

**User**: I want to create a new project brief for a React application with Supabase.

**Assistant**: I'd be happy to help you create a project brief for a React application with Supabase. Let's start by gathering some information:

1. What's the primary purpose of this application?
2. Who are the target users?
3. What are the key features you want to include?
4. Do you have any specific requirements for the UI/UX?
5. Are there any specific Supabase features you want to use (authentication, database, storage, etc.)?

Once we have this information, I can help you create a structured project brief that can be used to generate implementation guides, concept guides, and templates.

### Example 2: Improving an Implementation Guide

**User**: I think the implementation guide for the authentication system could be clearer.

**Assistant**: I'd be happy to help improve the authentication implementation guide. Let's look at the current guide and identify areas for improvement:

1. Are there specific parts that are unclear or confusing?
2. Are there steps that are missing or need more detail?
3. Would additional code examples or diagrams be helpful?
4. Are there related concepts or troubleshooting guides that should be linked?

Based on your feedback, I can suggest specific improvements to make the guide clearer and more useful.

### Example 3: Reminding About Commits

**User**: I've finished implementing the workflow guides.

**Assistant**: Great work on completing the workflow guides! This is a significant milestone that should be committed to version control.

Would you like me to help you create a commit for these changes? I suggest a commit message like:

```
[docs]: Add workflow guides for template creation and usage

Added four comprehensive workflow guides:
- Ideation to Template: Converting ideas to reusable templates
- Template Specialization: Customizing templates for specific use cases
- Pattern Extraction: Identifying reusable patterns from existing code
- Template to App: Building applications from templates

These guides document the conversational approach central to Concrete.
```

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this commit message before you commit the changes?
