# React/Vite Project with Supabase

*This is a Concrete-powered project. Concrete helps bring structure to your vision and enables AI to more effectively assist in development.*

## Project Overview

*[This section will be filled with your project vision and goals as they develop through our conversations.]*

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - React 18+
  - TypeScript
  - Vite (for fast builds and development)
  - TailwindCSS (for styling)
  - React Router (for routing)

- **Backend**:
  - Supabase (for authentication, database, storage, and more)

- **Testing**:
  - Vitest
  - React Testing Library

- **Code Quality**:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier

## Project Structure

### Frontend Structure

- **`src/`**: Source code directory
  - **`components/`**: Reusable React components
  - **`pages/`**: Page components for routing
  - **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks
  - **`lib/`**: Utility functions and libraries
  - **`styles/`**: CSS/SCSS files
  - **`types/`**: TypeScript type definitions
  - **`api/`**: API integration with Supabase

- **`public/`**: Static assets

### Supabase Structure

- **Authentication**: User management and authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database tables and relationships
- **Storage**: File storage buckets
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions (if needed)

### Concrete Structure

This project uses the Concrete system to provide structure and guidance. Here's how it works:

- **`.concrete/`**: The Concrete system for this project
  - **`conversations/`**: Summaries of our important discussions
  - **`ideation/`**: Your thoughts, brainstorming, and vision documents
  - **`guides/`**: Step-by-step guides for project milestones (will be created as needed)
  - **`README.md`**: This file - the central documentation for your project
  - **`tracking.md`**: Progress tracking and next steps
  - **`system-prompt.md`**: Guidelines for the AI assistant (you don't need to modify this)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm/pnpm
- Git
- A Supabase account

### Initial Setup

1. **Share your vision**: Tell the AI assistant about your project idea, or create an ideation document.

2. **Refine the project structure**: Work with the AI to define the project structure, milestones, and goals.

3. **Set up the project**: The AI will help you set up a new Vite project with React, TypeScript, and Supabase integration.

4. **Track progress**: Use the tracking.md file to monitor progress and plan next steps.

## How to Share Your Vision

There are two main ways to share your ideas and vision for this project:

1. **Direct conversation**: Simply chat with the AI assistant about your ideas, and they will help refine and structure them.

2. **Ideation documents**: For more complex or detailed thoughts, create a document in the `.concrete/ideation/` folder. The AI will read these documents and help you develop your ideas.

## Supabase Integration

The AI assistant will help you with:

- Setting up a Supabase project
- Configuring authentication
- Designing your database schema
- Implementing Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Creating API integrations
- Setting up file storage
