# Guides

This folder will contain step-by-step guides for implementing project milestones.

## How This Works

1. As your project develops, the AI assistant will help create guide files for each milestone
2. These guides will be numbered sequentially (e.g., `00-project-setup.md`, `01-feature-implementation.md`)
3. Each guide will include clear steps, user actions, and next steps

## Guide Structure

Each guide typically includes:

- **Objectives**: What the milestone aims to accomplish
- **Steps**: Detailed instructions for implementation
- **User Actions**: Tasks that require your input or approval
- **Next Steps**: What to do after completing the milestone

Guides will be created as needed based on your project's specific requirements and milestones.
