# Bump Application

*This is a Concrete-powered project. Concrete helps bring structure to your vision and enables AI to more effectively assist in development.*

## Project Overview

*[This section will be filled with your vision and goals for the Bump application as they develop through our conversations.]*

## About Bump

Bump is a React/Vite application with Supabase integration. The specific features and functionality will be defined based on your vision document.

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - React 18+
  - TypeScript
  - Vite (for fast builds and development)
  - TailwindCSS (for styling)
  - React Router (for routing)

- **Backend**:
  - Supabase (for authentication, database, storage, and more)

- **Testing**:
  - Vitest
  - React Testing Library

- **Code Quality**:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier

## Project Structure

The project structure will be refined based on your specific requirements for Bump, but will generally follow these patterns:

### Frontend Structure

- **`src/`**: Source code directory
  - **`components/`**: Reusable React components
  - **`pages/`**: Page components for routing
  - **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks
  - **`lib/`**: Utility functions and libraries
  - **`styles/`**: CSS/SCSS files
  - **`types/`**: TypeScript type definitions
  - **`api/`**: API integration with Supabase

- **`public/`**: Static assets

### Concrete Structure

This project uses the Concrete system to provide structure and guidance. Here's how it works:

- **`.concrete/`**: The Concrete system for this project
  - **`conversations/`**: Summaries of our important discussions
  - **`ideation/`**: Your thoughts, brainstorming, and vision documents
  - **`guides/`**: Step-by-step guides for project milestones (will be created as needed)
  - **`README.md`**: This file - the central documentation for your project
  - **`tracking.md`**: Progress tracking and next steps
  - **`system-prompt.md`**: Guidelines for the AI assistant (you don't need to modify this)

## Getting Started with Bump

### Step 1: Share Your Vision

The first step is to share your vision for the Bump application. You can do this by:

1. Creating a document in the `.concrete/ideation/` folder (e.g., `bump-vision.md`)
2. Describing the core purpose, target users, key features, and any other important aspects of Bump
3. Sharing this document with the AI assistant

### Step 2: Refine the Project Plan

Once you've shared your vision, the AI assistant will:

1. Ask clarifying questions to ensure a complete understanding
2. Help refine the project structure and milestones
3. Update this README and the tracking document to reflect your specific vision
4. Create custom guides for implementing Bump's features

### Step 3: Begin Development

With a clear plan in place, you'll:

1. Set up the initial project structure
2. Implement features according to the milestones
3. Track progress and adjust the plan as needed

## How to Share Your Vision

There are two main ways to share your ideas and vision for Bump:

1. **Direct conversation**: Simply chat with the AI assistant about your ideas, and they will help refine and structure them.

2. **Ideation documents**: For more complex or detailed thoughts, create a document in the `.concrete/ideation/` folder. The AI will read these documents and help you develop your ideas.
