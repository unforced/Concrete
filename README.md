# Concrete

Concrete is an AI-powered system that helps create consistent, well-structured projects through conversational AI development. The name "Concrete" comes from "Converse & Create" - emphasizing the conversational approach to project creation.

## Overview

- Implementation guides for project milestones
- Concept guides explaining core concepts
- Templates for consistent code and documentation
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
