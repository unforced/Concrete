# Concrete (Converse & Create)

Concrete is an open-source AI-powered project generator that transforms conversations into fully-realized projects. The current version specializes in generating Hugo static websites through natural dialogue.

## Overview

Concrete takes a unique, compartmentalized approach to project generation:

1. **Conversational Understanding**: Engages users in natural dialogue to understand their personal brand, project vision, and goals
2. **Structured Planning**: Generates foundational markdown files that outline the project's:
   - Visual style (`style.md`)
   - Site structure (`structure.md`)
   - Page overviews
3. **Implementation**: Transforms these specifications into a complete Hugo website

## How It Works

1. **Conversation**: Start a dialogue about your project
2. **Clarification**: AI ensures clear understanding of your vision
3. **Documentation**: Generates structured markdown specifications
4. **Generation**: Creates Hugo website files based on specifications
