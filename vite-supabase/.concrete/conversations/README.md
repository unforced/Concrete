# Conversations

This folder contains summaries of important conversations between you and the AI assistant.

## How This Works

1. After significant discussions with the AI assistant, they will offer to save a summary
2. These summaries will be stored here with the format `{date-of-convo}-{title-of-convo}.md`
3. You can refer back to these summaries to track the evolution of your project

## Benefits

- Creates a record of important decisions and insights
- Helps track the evolution of your project over time
- Makes it easy to onboard new team members or refresh your memory
- Provides continuity across different conversation sessions

The AI assistant will periodically suggest saving conversation summaries, but you can also request one at any time.
